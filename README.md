# CI/CD Pipeline: Build, Test, Push, Deploy
This repository implements a CI/CD pipeline with four stages: Build, Test, Push, and Deploy. The pipeline ensures code quality, streamlines deployment, and maintains continuous integration and delivery.

## Pipeline Stages
### 1. Build

    - Compiles the application and validates dependencies.
    - Generates a Docker image for containerized deployment.
Test

Executes unit and integration tests.
Ensures code meets quality standards and behaves as expected.
Push

Pushes the built Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR).
Deploy

Deploys the application to the target environment (e.g., Kubernetes, AWS, or on-premises servers).
Prerequisites
Docker installed and configured.
Access to a container registry.
Deployment environment configured (e.g., Kubernetes cluster, AWS infrastructure).
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
Configure your CI/CD pipeline:

Update the .github/workflows/pipeline.yml file with your environment details.
Push your changes to trigger the pipeline:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Trigger CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
Workflow Overview
The pipeline is configured in a GitHub Actions workflow file: .github/workflows/pipeline.yml. It automatically triggers on commits and pull requests to the main branch.
