# CI/CD Pipeline: Build, Test, Push, Deploy
This repository implements a CI/CD pipeline with four stages: Build, Test, Push, and Deploy. The pipeline ensures code quality, streamlines deployment, and maintains continuous integration and delivery.

## Pipeline Stages
### 1. Build

    - Compiles the application and validates dependencies.
    - Generates a Docker image for containerized deployment.

### 2. Test
    
    -Executes unit and integration tests.
    -Ensures code meets quality standards and behaves as expected.

### 3. Push
    
    - Pushes the built Docker image to a container registry (Docker Hub).

### 4. Deploy

    - Deploys the application to the target environment (Docker Machine).

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed and configured.
- Access to a container registry.
- Deployment environment configured such as machine up and running, ssh .
